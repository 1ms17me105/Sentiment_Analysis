### Simple lightweight sentiment analysis API which is finetuned to analyse movie reviews :clapper:

## Highlights of the project:
* ### Fine-Tuning transformer based model:
  - I chose BERT and RoBERTa LLM models provided through Huggingface'sðŸ¤— `transformers` package to check pretuned accuracy on a large move review dataset
  - Though RoBERTa provided a higher accuracy of 95% I chose to go with BERT (which provided a base pretrained accuracy of 88%) because it was 1/3rd the size of RoBERTa
  - BERT model was further finetuned using Full Parameter Tuning and Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) method which improved the accuracy from 88% to 93%

* ### Integrating a simple FastAPI endpoint to the model:
